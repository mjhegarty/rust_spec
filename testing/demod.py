# code adapted from
#https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/capture-and-decode-fm-radio/

#Basically what this does is it takes my data that has been correctly formatted
#By bash and makes it into a numpy array centered around +1 to -1, then does
#a whole bunch of DSP in a nutshell:
#1. Downsample signal: The sampling rate of IQ data usually only needs to be
#as high as the bandwidth of the signal, which is about 200KHz in this case.
#We also use a lowpass filter to get rid of any externous signals that would
#affect us. (Think it is a similiar concept to an image freq filter)

#2. Do polar discrimination on signal to demodulate it: This stage uses a nifty
#DSP trick that lets you get Ï•(t) of the signal

#3. Do de-emphasis on the demodulated signal to balance it out:
#When sending signals over the air they use a highpass filter to increase
#the power of the higher frequency signals, since there is more noise at
#the higher signals. We therefore need to use a lowpass filter to remove this
#increase. The author of the article just manually defined the coefficents for #a FIR filter which I honestly forget how to calculate

#4. Downsample again to just get mono signal: FM has a mono channel, along with
#several other channels, but all we want is the mono channel so we just keep
#about the first 40 KHz where it is stored

#5. Store as 16bit LE in a raw audio file
